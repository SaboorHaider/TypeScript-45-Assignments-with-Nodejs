//35. Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal

//Creating a Array
let petAnimals = ["Dog" , "Cat", "Rabbit"]

//Using For-Loop
for(let onePet of petAnimals){
    console.log(`A ${onePet} would make a great pet`);
    
}

//Print a message outside of For-loop
console.log("Any of these animals would make a great pet!");
