//34. Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a array, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.

//Creating a Array
let pizza = ["Chicken Tika", "Malai Cheese", "Fajita"]

//Using For-loop
for (let onePizza of pizza){
    console.log(`I like ${onePizza} pizza`);
}

//Print a message outside of the for-loop
console.log("I eat Pizza");
