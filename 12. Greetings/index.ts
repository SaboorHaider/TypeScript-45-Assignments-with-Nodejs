//12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.


let names2 : string [] = ["hussan","Abbas","Ali","Raza"];
names2.forEach(items => {
    console.log(`${items}, would you like to learn something`)
});
